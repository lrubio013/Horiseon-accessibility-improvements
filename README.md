# Horiseon-accessibility-improvements
## Summary of Challenge 1

### Purpose of the project
In this challenge I was given code to a website called Horiseon. The goal was to add semantics to the html code to make it more accessible to everone. Giving the website semantic elements also give it better structure and will make it easier to code. In the CSS I deleted a bunch of uneccessary code. I also resstructured the css stylesheet to better correlate with the HTML file. After I restructured the CSS sheet, I provided comments so anyone can understand what code does what. Lastly, I provided a helpful **README** file to go along with the project.

### What I learned
I learned the best practices on how to correctly structure a HTML and CSS file. I also learned how to get rid of a bunch of useless code in CSS to make things easier to follow and read. I also learned to comment my CSS sheet to explain my code to fellow coders. I also created a helpful README file to ensure that the people that come accross my project can easily learn the purpose of the project and what I did to accomplish said goal.
